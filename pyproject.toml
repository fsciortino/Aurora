    # omfit_classes will have issues with newer versions
    # of xarray for two different reasons:
    # 1. because of a recently-introduced xarray bug that
    #    will be fixed in the next release after v2024.02.0
    #    (this commit: https://github.com/pydata/xarray/commit/a241845c0dfcb8a5a0396f5ef7602e9dae6155c0).
    #    This constrains xarray<=v2023.07.0.
    # 2. because omfit_classes uses xarray.plot.plot, which has
    #    been removed/renamed by a commit from October 2022.
    #    This constrains xarray<=v2022.09.0
