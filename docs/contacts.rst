Questions and contributions
===========================

For any questions on Aurora, to brainstorm on possible applications or request changes to the code, please contact francesco.sciortino-at-ipp.mpg.de.

The code is developed and maintained by F. Sciortino (MPI-IPP) in collaboration with T. Odstrcil (GA) and contributions by A. Cavallaro (MIT), C. Johnson (ORNL), O. Linder (MPI-IPP), R. Reksoatmodjo (W&M), A. Rosenthal (MIT), D. Vezinet (CEA). For an updated list of contributors, please see the Github contributors list. 

The great wisdom (and patience) of S. Smith (GA) has allowed this code to be effectively shared and documented. Finally, the STRAHL documentation provided by R.Dux (MPI-IPP) was extremely helpful to guide code development.

New contributors are more than welcome! Please get in touch via email or open a pull-request via Github. 

Generally, we would appreciate if you could work with us to merge your features back into the main Aurora distribution if there is any chance that the changes that you made could be useful to others.
